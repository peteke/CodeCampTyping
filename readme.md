A simple prototype in very poor code quality from an afternoon in a wooden cabin with an open fire for a typing game.

The theme was actually SignalR, but I had an idea of a multiplayer typing game, and did this besides our other multi-map SignalR app.

It does not contain any multiplayer stubs at all, pure single player. We had some fun testing it anyway.
